# LonaDB-Client

This is the JavaScript Client for [LonaDB](https://github.com/LonaDB/Server)

LunaDB is my 3rd attempt in creating my own "database".
Please keep in mind that this is a early prototype.

1st attempt: [ShinoaDB](https://github.com/Hanyaku-Chan/ShinoaDB)
2nd attempt: [AnbuDB](https://github.com/Hanyaku-Chan/AnbuDB)

## Installation.

```bash
npm i lonadb-client
```

## Usage

To use LonaDB, you have to use the LonaDB Client for JavaScript or create your own Client.

```javascript
let LunaDB = require("lonadb-client");
let database = new LonaDB("Host", Port, "Login Name", "Login Password");
```

You can currently do:
- LonaDB.set(table, name, value)
- LonaDB.get(table, name)
- LonaDB.remove(table, name)
- LonaDB.createTable(name)


And you can manage users if you have access to the Administrator user:
- LonaDB.createUser(name, password)
- LonaDB.deleteUser(name)

The users created can be used to access the database. (What else should we use them for? Any suggestions? Open a issue!)
